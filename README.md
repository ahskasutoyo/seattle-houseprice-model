# Predictive Modeling of House Prices in Seattle

## Overview
This repository contains the research and implementation files for my MSc Business Analytics Consultancy Project/Dissertation titled "Predictive Modeling of House Price - Integrating Traditional Real Estate Data with Points of Interest in Seattle." The project explores the integration of advanced machine learning techniques and POI data to enhance house price prediction models, specifically focusing on the Seattle housing market.

## Project Description
Traditional predictive models often rely on historical data and basic structural attributes, which may not capture the complexities of modern urban environments. This research aims to develop a more nuanced understanding of factors influencing property values by incorporating a comprehensive dataset that includes both conventional real estate metrics and diverse POIsâ€”such as schools, parks, and transportation hubs.

## Repository Structure
- data/: This folder contains the datasets in the analyses, including Redfin real estate data and POI data collected via the Google Places API.
- preprocess/: Source code for the project specifically for data collection and preprocessing.
- model/: All model tested for the project.
- docs/: Documentation with detailed analysis and model development steps.

## Models
Various machine learning algorithms were used, including:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Neural Networks
Models were rigorously tested against real-world data to evaluate their accuracy and reliability.

## Results
Results can be found in the docs folder, complete with detailed analysis.

## Acknowledgments
Special thanks to my supervisor, colleagues who provided insights and expertise that greatly assisted the research, and my family and friends who supported me during my studies.

## Additional Notes
- There a total of 192 models being tested in this project, in which resulted into the python script being divided into a total of 9 scripts.
- Due to the large size of the EDA file, visualization from EDA can only be seen in the final report in the docs/ folder.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions on this!
