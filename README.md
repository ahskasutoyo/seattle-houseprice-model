# Predictive Modeling of House Prices in Seattle

## Overview
This repository contains the research and implementation files for my MSc Business Analytics Consultancy Project/Dissertation titled "Predictive Modeling of House Price - Integrating Traditional Real Estate Data with Points of Interest in Seattle." The project explores the integration of advanced machine learning techniques and POI data to enhance house price prediction models, specifically focusing on the Seattle housing market.

## Project Description
Traditional predictive models often rely on historical data and basic structural attributes, which may not capture the complexities of modern urban environments. This research aims to develop a more nuanced understanding of factors influencing property values by incorporating a comprehensive dataset that includes both conventional real estate metrics and diverse POIsâ€”such as schools, parks, and transportation hubs.
